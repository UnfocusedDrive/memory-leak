# memoryleak.ai
## @nurvus/memory-leak project
### We require more memory.

## Getting Started - Client
1. cd client/
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`
4. Give us more memory.

## CI/CD - Info
1. All commits from `master` will run builds and if successful, will deploy to the staging (pre-production) site unstable.memoryleak.ai. You can use this URL for direct feedback and testing on your device without influencing the production deployed at memoryleak.ai

## Interested in more?
### Feel free to contribute -- more memory, ask questions, comment on anything.
